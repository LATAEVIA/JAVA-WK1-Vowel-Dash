## Description

_This a static Java application assigned as an end-of-week project for my sixth week at Epicodus. It functions as a website that uses a method to replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol "-" to create a word puzzle to solve. The resulting word puzzle will be on a new page that does not show the original string so that another person can try and guess it_
